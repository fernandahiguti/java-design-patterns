# Java Design Patterns

This repository contains a Java class project that reproduces the implementation of three popular design patterns: Singleton, Strategy, and Facade, as taught in a class setting. Design patterns are reusable solutions to common problems in software design.

## Design Patterns Included:

1. **Singleton Pattern**: Ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance.

2. **Strategy Pattern**: Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. It allows you to select an algorithm at runtime.

3. **Facade Pattern**: Provides a simplified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem, making it easier to use and understand.
